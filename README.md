## Koodikirja

Koodikirja is an online book for learning programming. The site is published at http://www.koodikirja.fi/.

The book is available only in Finnish for now, so here you have yet another reason to learn this unique language.

The whole build/runtime system can be run on the local developement machine without a database server or anything else; all content is included in this git repository. This means you can author content and code on your local machine and deploy the result onto Heroku hosting when everything is ok.

Development instructions below.

## Install

Run

    bundle install
    npm install

Npm install will also run the Grunt build (compiles the less stylesheets) and Bower install
(downloads client-side javascripts).

## Start the server

Run

    ./server

This runs `nanoc` compilation and then starts the server.

Now visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` and there you go.

## Auto-compiling when you update files

Just

    grunt

Will auto-compile all content.

## Heroku Deployment

You can manually deploy by

    git push heroku master

Automatic deploy from Github is also set up so you probably need not do that.

Buildpacks used: `heroku/ruby`, `heroku/nodejs`
Heroku stack: `heroku-18`
Node.js and ruby versions specified in `package.json` and `Gemfile` respectively

## How the build/runtime system works

Koodikirja uses `nanoc` for building the site content and `grunt` for building javascript and static resources.
In general, assets from `/app`, `/content`, `/layouts` will be transformed into assets in `/output`. Static assets
in `/static` directory will be served as-is. The node.js based `express` web server is used for serving content.
The server code can be found in `server.js`.

### The `nanoc` build

- Build markdown pages from `/content` into HTML pages in `/output` directory
- Use HTML/ERB layouts in `/layouts` directory to include common templates, partials, scripts and styles

### The `grunt` build

- Build LESS stylesheets from `/app/less` into CSS in `/output/less`
- Concat/optimize javascripts from `/app/js` into `/output/koodikirja.js`
